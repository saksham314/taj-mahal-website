    <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 20px">Beyond the captivating white marble of the Taj Mahal lies a serene paradise – the Char Bagh. This Mughal-era garden design, meaning "four gardens," unfolds in a breathtaking display of symmetry, water features, and vibrant flora.</p>

      <h3>A Tapestry of Symmetry and Tranquility</h3>
      <p>The Char Bagh embodies the essence of Mughal garden design. It's laid out in a perfect square, divided into four smaller squares by water channels that run east-west and north-south. These channels, lined with cypress trees, symbolize the four rivers of paradise mentioned in Islamic texts.</p>

      <p>At the center of the Char Bagh lies a reflecting pool, mirroring the Taj Mahal's grandeur. Lush green walkways bordered by flowering trees and shrubs create a calming contrast with the white marble. The geometric layout and water features evoke a sense of order and serenity, inviting reflection and peace.</p>

    <h3>A Symphony of Colors and Fragrances</h3>
    <p>The Char Bagh is not just a visual treat; it's a sensory experience. During peak bloom, the gardens come alive with a vibrant palette of colors. Roses, marigolds, lilies, and jasmine fill the air with a delightful fragrance. Seasonal changes bring new hues – orange, red, and yellow leaves in autumn, and fresh green shoots in spring.</p>

    <p>The meticulous selection of plants adds to the symbolism of the gardens. Cypress trees, with their tall and slender forms, represent stability and life. Fruit trees like pomegranates and oranges symbolize abundance and prosperity.</p>
