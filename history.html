    <h2>A Love Story Etched in Stone: The History of the Taj Mahal</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Taj Mahal, an architectural marvel in white marble, stands as a timeless testament to love and loss. Its captivating beauty has captivated hearts for centuries. But the story behind its creation is equally fascinating.</p>

    <h3>Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal: A Love for the Ages</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Taj Mahal was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned 1628-1658) in memory of his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Their love story is well-documented, with accounts describing their deep affection and companionship. Mumtaz Mahal was not just Shah Jahan's wife, but also his confidante and constant companion. Her untimely death during childbirth in 1631 left Shah Jahan grief-stricken.</p>

    <h3>A Grand Design: Building the Taj Mahal</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To honor Mumtaz Mahal's memory, Shah Jahan embarked on an ambitious project to create the most magnificent mausoleum the world had ever seen. Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and employed over 20,000 artisans and laborers from across India and Central Asia. The project took an estimated 22 years to complete, with meticulous attention to detail and the use of precious materials like marble, jade, and lapis lazuli.</p>
